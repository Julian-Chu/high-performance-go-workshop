= Welcome

Hello and welcome! ðŸŽ‰

The goal for this workshop is to give you the tools you need to diagnose performance problems in your Go applications and fix them.

Through the day we'll work from the small -- learning how to write benchmarks, then profiling a small piece of code. Then step out and talk about the execution tracer, the garbage collector  and tracing running applications. The remainder of the day will be a chance for you to ask questions, experiment with your own code.

== Prerequisites

The are several software downloads you will need today.

Download this repo on {github}

=== Laptop, power supplies, etc.

The workshop material targets Go 1.12.

https://golang.org/dl/[Download Go 1.12]

NOTE: If you've already upgraded to Go 1.13 that's ok. There are always some small changes to optimisation choices between minor Go releases and I'll try to point those out as we go along.

=== Graphviz

The section on pprof requires the `dot` program which ships with the `graphviz` suite of tools.

- Linux: `[sudo] apt-get install graphviz`
- OSX:
  - MacPorts: `sudo port install graphviz`
  - Homebrew: `brew install graphviz`
- https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/#Windows[Windows] (untested) 

=== Google Chrome

The section on the execution tracer requires Google Chrome.
It will not work with Safari, Edge, Firefox, or IE 4.01.
Please tell your battery I'm sorry. 

https://www.google.com/chrome/[Download Google Chrome]

=== Your own code to profile and optimise

The final section of the day will be an open session where you can experiment with the tools you've learnt.

== One more thing ...

This isn't a lecture, it's a conversation.
We'll have lots of breaks to ask questions.

If you don't understand something, or think what you're hearing not correct, please ask.
