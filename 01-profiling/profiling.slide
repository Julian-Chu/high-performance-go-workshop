* Performance measurement and profiling

In this section we'll use profiling tools built into Go to investigate the operation of the program from the inside.

* pprof

The first tool we're going to be talking about today is _pprof_.

[[https://github.com/google/pprof][pprof]] descends from the [[https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools][Google Perf Tools]] suite of tools.

`pprof` profiling is built into the Go runtime.

It consists of two parts:

- `runtime/pprof` package built into every Go program
- `go`tool`pprof` for investigating profiles.

pprof supports several types of profiling, we'll discuss three of these today: 

- CPU profiling.
- Memory profiling.
- Block (or blocking) profiling.
- Mutex contention profiling.

* CPU profiling

CPU profiling is the most common type of profile, and the most obvious. 

When CPU profiling is enabled the runtime will interrupt itself every 10ms and record the stack trace of the currently running goroutines.

Once the profile is complete we can analyse it to determine the hottest code paths.

The more times a function appears in the profile, the more time that code path is taking as a percentage of the total runtime.

* Memory profiling

Memory profiling records the stack trace when a _heap_ allocation is made.

Stack allocations are assumed to be free and are _not_tracked_ in the memory profile.

Memory profiling, like CPU profiling is sample based, by default memory profiling samples 1 in every 1000 allocations. This rate can be changed.

Because of memory profiling is sample based and because it tracks _allocations_ not _use_, using memory profiling to determine your application's overall memory usage is difficult.

_Personal_Opinion:_ I do not find memory profiling useful for finding memory leaks. There are better ways to determine how much memory your application is using. We will discuss these later in the presentation.

* Block profiling

Block profiling is quite unique. 

A block profile is similar to a CPU profile, but it records the amount of time a goroutine spent waiting for a shared resource.

This can be useful for determining _concurrency_ bottlenecks in your application.

Block profiling can show you when a large number of goroutines _could_ make progress, but were _blocked_. Blocking includes:

- Sending or receiving on a unbuffered channel.
- Sending to a full channel, receiving from an empty one.
- Trying to `Lock` a `sync.Mutex` that is locked by another goroutine.

Block profiling is a very specialised tool, it should not be used until you believe you have eliminated all your CPU and memory usage bottlenecks.

* One profile at at time

Profiling is not free.

Profiling has a moderate, but measurable impact on program performanceâ€”especially if you increase the memory profile sample rate.

Most tools will not stop you from enabling multiple profiles at once.

If you enable multiple profile's at the same time, they will observe their own interactions and throw off your results.

*Do*not*enable*more*than*one*kind*of*profile*at*a*time.*

* Using pprof

Now that I've talked about what pprof can measure, I will talk about how to use pprof to analyse a profile.

pprof should always be invoked with _two_ arguments.

    go tool pprof /path/to/your/binary /path/to/your/profile

The `binary` argument *must* be the binary that produced this profile.

The `profile` argument *must* be the profile generated by this binary.

*Warning*: Because pprof also supports an online mode where it can fetch profiles from a running application over http, the pprof tool can be invoked without the name of your binary ([[https://github.com/golang/go/issues/10863][issue 10863]]):

    go tool pprof /tmp/c.pprof

*Do*not*do*this*or*pprof*will*report*your*profile*is*empty.*

* Using pprof (cont.)

This is a sample CPU profile:

	% go tool pprof $BINARY /tmp/c.p
	Entering interactive mode (type "help" for commands)
	(pprof) top
	Showing top 15 nodes out of 63 (cum >= 4.85s)
	      flat  flat%   sum%        cum   cum%
	    21.89s  9.84%  9.84%    128.32s 57.71%  net.(*netFD).Read
	    17.58s  7.91% 17.75%     40.28s 18.11%  runtime.exitsyscall
	    15.79s  7.10% 24.85%     15.79s  7.10%  runtime.newdefer
	    12.96s  5.83% 30.68%    151.41s 68.09%  test_frame/connection.(*ServerConn).readBytes
	    11.27s  5.07% 35.75%     23.35s 10.50%  runtime.reentersyscall
	    10.45s  4.70% 40.45%     82.77s 37.22%  syscall.Syscall
	     9.38s  4.22% 44.67%      9.38s  4.22%  runtime.deferproc_m
	     9.17s  4.12% 48.79%     12.73s  5.72%  exitsyscallfast
	     8.03s  3.61% 52.40%     11.86s  5.33%  runtime.casgstatus
	     7.66s  3.44% 55.85%      7.66s  3.44%  runtime.cas
	     7.59s  3.41% 59.26%      7.59s  3.41%  runtime.onM
	     6.42s  2.89% 62.15%    134.74s 60.60%  net.(*conn).Read
	     6.31s  2.84% 64.98%      6.31s  2.84%  runtime.writebarrierptr
	     6.26s  2.82% 67.80%     32.09s 14.43%  runtime.entersyscall

Often this output is hard to understand.

* Using pprof (cont.)

A better way to understand your profile is to visualise it.

	% go tool pprof application /tmp/c.p
	Entering interactive mode (type "help" for commands)
	(pprof) web

Opens a web page with a graphical display of the profile.

.link images/profile.svg 

_Note_: visualisation requires graphviz.

I find this method to be superior to the text mode, I strongly recommend you try it.

pprof also supports these modes in a non interactive form with flags like `-svg`, `-pdf`, etc. See `go`tool`pprof`-help` for more details.

* Using pprof (cont.) 

The output of a memory profile can be similarly visualised.

    % go build -gcflags='-memprofile=/tmp/m.p'
    % go tool pprof --alloc_objects -svg $(go tool -n compile) /tmp/m.p > alloc_objects.svg
    % go tool pprof --inuse_objects -svg $(go tool -n compile) /tmp/m.p > inuse_objects.svg

Memory profiles come in two varieties

- Alloc objects reports the call site where each allocation was made

.link images/alloc_objects.svg

- Inuse objects reports the call site where an allocation was made _iff_ it was reachable at the end of the profile

.link images/inuse_objects.svg

DEMO: `examples/inuseallocs`

* Using pprof (cont.) 

Here is a visualisation of a block profile:

    % go test -run=XXX -bench=ClientServer -blockprofile=/tmp/b.p net/http
    % go tool pprof -svg http.test /tmp/b.p > block.svg

.link images/block.svg 

* Profiling benchmarks

The `testing` package has built in support for generating CPU, memory, and block profiles.

- `-cpuprofile=$FILE` writes a CPU profile to `$FILE`. 
- `-memprofile=$FILE`, writes a memory profile to `$FILE`, `-memprofilerate=N` adjusts the profile rate to `1/N`.
- `-blockprofile=$FILE`, writes a block profile to `$FILE`.

Using any of these flags also preserves the binary.

    % go test -run=XXX -bench=. -cpuprofile=c.p bytes
    % go tool pprof bytes.test c.p

_Note:_ use `-run=XXX` to disable tests, you only want to profile benchmarks. You can also use `-run=^$` to accomplish the same thing.

* Profiling applications

Profiling `testing` benchmarks is useful for _microbenchmarks_.

We use microbenchmarks inside the standard library to make sure individual packages do not regress, but what if you want to profile a complete application?

The Go runtime's profiling interface is in the `runtime/pprof` package.

`runtime/pprof` is a very low level tool, and for historic reasons the interfaces to the different kinds of profile are not uniform.

A few years ago I wrote a small package, [[https://github.com/pkg/profile][github.com/pkg/profile]], to make it easier to profile an application.

     import "github.com/pkg/profile"

     func main() {
           defer profile.Start().Stop()
           ...
     }

* Exercise

- Generate a profile from a piece of code you know well. If you don't have a code sample, try profiling `godoc`.

- If you were to generate a profile on one machine and inspect it on another, how would you do it?

* Framepointers

Go 1.7 has been released and along with a new compiler for amd64, the compiler now enables frame pointers by default.

The frame pointer is a register that always points to the top of the current stack frame.

Framepointers enable tools like `gdb(1)`, and `perf(1)` to understand the Go call stack.

We won't cover these tools in this workshop, but you can read and watch a presentation I gave on seven different ways to profile Go programs.
