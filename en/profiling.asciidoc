[#profiling]
= Performance measurement and profiling

In the previous section we looked at benchmarking individual functions which is useful when you know ahead of time where the bottlekneck is. However, often you will find yourself in the position of asking

> Why is this program taking so long to run?

Profiling _whole_ programs which is useful for answering high level questions like. In this section we'll use profiling tools built into Go to investigate the operation of the program from the inside.

== pprof

The first tool we're going to be talking about today is _pprof_. https://github.com/google/pprof[pprof] descends from the https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools[Google Perf Tools] suite of tools and has been integrated into the Go runtime since the earliest public releases.

`pprof`  consists of two parts:

- `runtime/pprof` package built into every Go program
- `go tool pprof` for investigating profiles.

== Types of profiles

pprof supports several types of profiling, we'll discuss three of these today: 

- CPU profiling.
- Memory profiling.
- Block (or blocking) profiling.
- Mutex contention profiling.

=== CPU profiling

CPU profiling is the most common type of profile, and the most obvious. 

When CPU profiling is enabled the runtime will interrupt itself every 10ms and record the stack trace of the currently running goroutines.

Once the profile is complete we can analyse it to determine the hottest code paths.

The more times a function appears in the profile, the more time that code path is taking as a percentage of the total runtime.

=== Memory profiling

Memory profiling records the stack trace when a _heap_ allocation is made.

Stack allocations are assumed to be free and are _not_tracked_ in the memory profile.

Memory profiling, like CPU profiling is sample based, by default memory profiling samples 1 in every 1000 allocations.
This rate can be changed.

Because of memory profiling is sample based and because it tracks _allocations_ not _use_, using memory profiling to determine your application's overall memory usage is difficult.

_Personal Opinion:_ I do not find memory profiling useful for finding memory leaks.
There are better ways to determine how much memory your application is using.
We will discuss these later in the presentation.

=== Block profiling

Block profiling is quite unique to Go.

A block profile is similar to a CPU profile, but it records the amount of time a goroutine spent waiting for a shared resource.

This can be useful for determining _concurrency_ bottlenecks in your application.

Block profiling can show you when a large number of goroutines _could_ make progress, but were _blocked_.
Blocking includes:

- Sending or receiving on a unbuffered channel.
- Sending to a full channel, receiving from an empty one.
- Trying to `Lock` a `sync.Mutex` that is locked by another goroutine.

Block profiling is a very specialised tool, it should not be used until you believe you have eliminated all your CPU and memory usage bottlenecks.

=== Mutex profiling

Mutex profiling is simlar to Block profiling, but is focused exclusively on operations that lead to delays caused by mutex contention.

I don't have a lot of experience with this type of profile but I have built an example to demonstrate it.
We'll look at that example shortly.

== One profile at at time

Profiling is not free.

Profiling has a moderate, but measurable impact on program performanceâ€”especially if you increase the memory profile sample rate.

Most tools will not stop you from enabling multiple profiles at once.

[WARNING]
====
Do not enable more than one kind of profile at a time.

If you enable multiple profile's at the same time, they will observe their own interactions and throw off your results.
====

== Collecting a profile

The Go runtime's profiling interface lives in the `runtime/pprof` package. `runtime/pprof` is a very low level tool, and for historic reasons the interfaces to the different kinds of profile are not uniform. 

As we saw in the previous section, pprof profiling is built into the `testing` package, but sometimes its inconvenient, or difficult, to place the code you want to profile in the context of at `testing.B` benchmark and must use the `runtime/pprof` API directly.

A few years ago I wrote a [small package][0], to make it easier to profile an existing application.

[source,go]
----
import "github.com/pkg/profile"
    
func main() {
	defer profile.Start().Stop()
	// ...
}
----
We'll use the profile package throughout this section. Later in the day we'll touch on using the `runtime/pprof` interface directly.

== Analysting a profile with pprof

Now that we've talked about what pprof can measure, and how to generate a profile, let's talk about how to use pprof to analyse a profile.

The analysis is driven by the `go pprof` subcommand
----
go tool pprof /path/to/your/profile
----

This tool provides several different representations of the profiling data; textual, graphical, even flame graphs.

[TIP]
====
If you've been using Go for a while, you might have been told that `pprof` takes two arguments. Since Go 1.9 the profile file contains all the information needed to render the profile. You do no longer need the binary which produced the profile. ðŸŽ‰

=== CPU profiling (exercise)

Let's write a program to count words:
[source,go,options="nowrap"]
----
include::../examples/words/main.go[]
----
Let's see how many words there are in Herman Melville's classic https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2701[Moby Dick] (sourced from Project Gutenberg)
[source]
----
% go build && time ./words moby.txt
"moby.txt": 181275 words

real    0m2.110s
user    0m1.264s
sys     0m0.944s
----
Let's compare that to unix's `wc -w`
[source]
----
% time wc -w moby.txt
215829 moby.txt

real    0m0.012s
user    0m0.009s
sys     0m0.002s
----
So the numbers aren't the same.
`wc` is about 19% higher because what it considers a word is different to what my simple program does.
That's not important--both programs take the whole file as input and in a single pass count the number of transitions from word to non word.

Let's investigate why these programs have different run times using pprof.

=== Add CPU profiling

First, edit `main.go` and enable profiling
[source,go]
----
import (
        "github.com/pkg/profile"
)

func main() {
        defer profile.Start().Stop()
        // ...
----
Now when we run the program a `cpu.pprof` file is created.
[source]
----
% go run main.go moby.txt
2018/08/25 14:09:01 profile: cpu profiling enabled, /var/folders/by/3gf34_z95zg05cyj744_vhx40000gn/T/profile239941020/cpu.pprof
"moby.txt": 181275 words
2018/08/25 14:09:03 profile: cpu profiling disabled, /var/folders/by/3gf34_z95zg05cyj744_vhx40000gn/T/profile239941020/cpu.pprof
----
Now we have the profile we can analyse it with `go tool pprof`
[source,options=nowrap]
----
% go tool pprof /var/folders/by/3gf34_z95zg05cyj744_vhx40000gn/T/profile239941020/cpu.pprof

         0     0%   100%      1.41s 99.30%  syscall.read
----
The `top` command is one you'll use the most. We can see that 99% of the time this program spends in `syscall.Syscall`, and a small part in `main.readbyte`. 

We can also visualise this call the with the `web` command. This will generate a directed graph from the profile data. Under the hood this uses the `dot` command from Graphviz.

image::images/profile001.svg[]

On the graph the box that consumes the _most_ CPU time is the largest -- we see `sys call.Syscall` at 99.3% of the total time spent in the program.
The string of boxes leading to `syscall.Syscall` represent the immediate callers -- there can be more than one if multiple code paths converge on the same function.
The size of the arrow represents how much time was spent in children of a box, we see that from `main.readbyte` onwards they account for near 0 of the 1.41 second spent in this arm of the graph.

_Question_: Can anyone guess why our version is so much slower than `wc`?

=== Improving our version

The reason our program is slow is not because Go's `syscall.Syscall` is slow.
It is because syscalls in general are expensive operations (and getting more expensive as more Spectre family vulnerabilities are discovered).

Each call to `readbyte` results in a syscall.Read with a buffer size of 1.
So the number of syscalls executed by our program is equal to the size of the input. We can see that in the pprof graph that reading the input dominates everything else.

By inserting a `bufio.Reader` between the input file and `readbyte` will 

====
Compare the times of this revised program to `wc`. How close is it? Take a profile and see what remains.
====

=== Memory profiling

The new `words` profile suggests that something is allocating inside the `readbyte` function. We can use pprof to investigate.
[source,go]
defer profile.Start(profile.MemProfile).Stop()

Then run the program as usual

[source,options=nowrap]
% go run main2.go moby.txt
2018/08/25 14:41:15 profile: memory profiling enabled (rate 4096), /var/folders/by/3gf34_z95zg05cyj744_vhx40000gn/T/profile312088211/mem.pprof
"moby.txt": 181275 words
2018/08/25 14:41:15 profile: memory profiling disabled, /var/folders/by/3gf34_z95zg05cyj744_vhx40000gn/T/profile312088211/mem.pprof

image::images/memprof.png[]

As we suspected the allocation was coming from `readbyte` -- this wasn't that complicated, readbyte is three lines long:

[source,go]
----
func readbyte(r io.Reader) (rune, error) {
        var buf [1]byte // <1>
        _, err := r.Read(buf[:])
        return rune(buf[0]), err
}
----
<1> Allocation is here

We'll talk about why this is happening in more detail in the next section, but for the moment what we see is every call to readbyte is allocating a new one byte long _array_ and that array is being allocated on the heap.

====
What are some ways we can avoid this? Try them and use CPU and memory profiling to prove it.
====

==== Alloc objects vs. inuse objects

Memory profiles come in two varieties, named after their `go tool pprof` flags

- `-alloc_objects` reports the call site where each allocation was made.
- `-inuse_objects` reports the call site where an allocation was made _iff_ it was reachable at the end of the profile.

To demonstrate this, here is a contrived program which will allocate a bunch of memory in a controlled manner.

[source,go,options=nowrap]
----
include::../examples/inuseallocs/main.go[tags=main]
----
The program is annotation with the `profile` package, and we set the memory profile rate  to `1`--that is, record a stack trace for every allocation. This is slows down the program a lot, but you'll see why in a minute.
[source,options=nowrap]
% go run main.go
2018/08/25 15:22:05 profile: memory profiling enabled (rate 1), /var/folders/by/3gf34_z95zg05cyj744_vhx40000gn/T/profile730812803/mem.pprof
2018/08/25 15:22:05 profile: memory profiling disabled, /var/folders/by/3gf34_z95zg05cyj744_vhx40000gn/T/profile730812803/mem.pprof

Lets look at the graph of allocated objects, this is the default, and shows the call graphs that lead to the allocation of every object during the profile.

[source,options=nowrap]
% go tool pprof -web -alloc_objects /var/folders/by/3gf34_z95zg05cyj744_vhx40000gn/T/profile891268605/mem.pprof

image::images/alloc_objects.svg[]

Not surprisingly more than 99% of the allocations were inside `makeByteSlice`. Now lets look at the same profile using `-inuse_objects`

[source,options=nowrap]
% go tool pprof -web -inuse_objects /var/folders/by/3gf34_z95zg05cyj744_vhx40000gn/T/profile891268605/mem.pprof

image::images/inuse_objects.svg[]

What we see is not the objects that were _allocated_ during the profile, but the objects that remain _in use_, at the time the profile was taken -- this ignores the stack trace for objects which have been reclaimed by the garbage collector.

=== Block profiling
The last profile type we'll look at is block profiling. We'll use the `ClientServer` benchmark from the `net/http` package 

[source,options=nowrap]
% go test -run=XXX -bench=ClientServer$ -blockprofile=/tmp/block.p net/http
% go tool pprof -web /tmp/block.p

image::images/blockprof.png[]

=== Framepointers

Go 1.7 has been released and along with a new compiler for amd64, the compiler now enables frame pointers by default.

The frame pointer is a register that always points to the top of the current stack frame.

Framepointers enable tools like `gdb(1)`, and `perf(1)` to understand the Go call stack.

We won't cover these tools in this workshop, but you can read and watch a presentation I gave on seven different ways to profile Go programs.

=== Exercise

- Generate a profile from a piece of code you know well. If you don't have a code sample, try profiling `godoc`.
[source]
% go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/godoc
% cd $GOPATH/src/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/godoc
% vim main.go
- If you were to generate a profile on one machine and inspect it on another, how would you do it?

=== What's coming up in Go 1.13?
